Project Title: Diabetes Prediction Using SVM

Description : 
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical data using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model is trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, a popular dataset in healthcare machine learning.

Key Features : 
Preprocessing of data with feature scaling.
Building and training an SVM model for classification.
Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Visualization of results with graphs like ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix.
Real-time diabetes prediction for new input data.

Technologies Used : 
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
